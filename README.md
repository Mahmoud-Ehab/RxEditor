# About
RxEditor is an open-source static web applciation, that gives users the facility to
write and design their own web blogs, slides, articles or even books, by using HTML.
Technically, the users data (HTML Nodes) is saved, in an abstract form, as JSON file.
Which can be loaded by the app to be viewed, edited, or exported as a pdf file with 
the desired style (normal, slide,... etc).

> It is not yet complete; users can only edit and view data with the app. However, any data exported (as JSON) from the current version will be available for different types of exports/styling in future versions.

# TODO
- Add fullscreen feature in the editor.
- Add buttons for resizing the font in ViewContent.
- Export data as md.
